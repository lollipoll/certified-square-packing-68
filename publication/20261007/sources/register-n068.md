# `s(68)` — open

**External intake, 2026-10-01.** wand125’s
[rectangle-density source](../resources/web/wand125-rectangle-certificates-2026-10-01/README.md)
reports `s(68) >= 851/100 = 8.51`, with total mass $6799/100 = 67.99 < 68$, accepted by
Tokoharu’s unchanged interval checker.
The complete 201-direction coverage replay here accepted it again, after this
repository’s exact audit checked that the regenerated checker input is the published one
and checked the mass and net premises, so it is also verified.
wand125’s README says parts of the work were produced with AI assistance under human
direction.

Open. The best known published packing, Francisco Couzo’s at Evan Daniel’s exact optimum
(T-098), gives $s(68) \le 8.7987952372182839027\ldots$, and the strongest verified lower
bound is $851/100 = 8.51$, from wand125’s rectangle-density certificate of 1 October
(`T-074`), leaving a gap of about $0.2888$. Before it the verified bound was
$1691/200 = 8.455$, from wand125’s n67 rectangle-density certificate by monotonicity
(`T-070`), and until 2026-10-02 $841/100$, from the complete exact replay of wand125’s
n69 point certificate and its stricter mass budget, which already excludes 68 squares.
The exact optimum remains open.

## The exact optimum

Evan Daniel’s
[`square-packing`](../resources/web/evand-square-packing-2026-10-05/README.md) published
on 5 October 2026 an exact rational certificate of this packing at its exact optimum
(T-098): the same 68 squares in a square of side $8.7987952372182839027\ldots$,
`4.3e-12` below the side Francisco Couzo prints.
Square for square, its pose lies within `4.3e-4` of the binary64 pose the atlas pictures
for this count. 4 squares move by more than `1e-8`, all of them squares the source lists
as carrying no force; every other square moves by at most `5.8e-12`. The known-best
witness this record lists is that binary64 pose, posed at its finder’s larger side; the
side above is witnessed by the certificate itself.
Evan Daniel’s solver moves the binary64 pose to a nearby exact KKT point of the problem
of minimizing the side under non-overlap, computed at 80 digits, and rounds it outward
to rationals, each square a rational centre and a rational $t = \tan(\theta/2)$.

This repository decides the certificate exactly.
Converted without rounding, every pair and every wall is decided over $\mathbb{Q}$
twice, by `sqpack`’s exact separating-axis test and by an independent checker that
shares no code with it, and the source’s own two checkers, run here as retained, accept
it as well
([receipts](../resources/web/evand-square-packing-2026-10-05/README.md#replayed-here)).
That proves $s(68) \le 8.7987952372182839027\ldots$, the verified upper bound; it says
nothing about optimality.
The source reports the exact point as a KKT local minimum: multipliers that keep it in
equilibrium, a reduced Hessian positive definite once its exact flat motions are set
aside (its per-count report), and no first-order descent across corner-to-corner
contacts, each computed numerically at that point; none of that is verified here, and it
bears on this packing alone, not on $s(68)$. On jlevy/squares#375 its author wrote that
the solver, its checkers and the batch “were written with Claude (Anthropic) as a coding
and research agent, directed and reviewed by me.”

## The packing

Francisco Couzo’s
[`square-packing`](../resources/web/franciscouzo-square-packing-2026-09-27/README.md)
reports a packing of side $8.798795237222592$ for this count, dated 26 September 2026
and unchanged when this record retained the repository on 27 September 2026 (T-056). The
repository names no method and no tolerance, and itself states no AI assistance; its
author said on [issue #227](https://github.com/jlevy/squares/issues/227) that he found
the 102 and 103 packings “with the help of Claude”.

This repository certifies it exactly.
The retained decimal pose rounds to an exact rational packing at centre dilation 1, of
side $8.7987952372225919633\ldots$, no larger than the printed side, and every pair and
every wall is decided over $\mathbb{Q}$ twice, by the promotion’s exact separating-axis
test and by an independent checker that shares no code with it
([receipt](../resources/web/franciscouzo-square-packing-2026-09-27/README.md#certified-here)).
That proves $s(68) \le 8.798795237222592$, which was the verified upper bound until Evan
Daniel’s exact optimum above replaced it; it says nothing about optimality.
Interval arithmetic on the printed pose itself, with each angle’s true cosine and sine
and no rational rounding, decides every pair and wall again and gives the same bound
([interval route](../resources/web/franciscouzo-square-packing-2026-09-27/README.md#interval-route)).

### The previous best known packing

Before this intake the best known packing was the UnitSquare Project’s, of side
$8.803383074716108386903836683375989697670063329$, below the Kingbird catalogue’s
$8.80345993651653$.

The UnitSquare Project’s 29 July 2026 release improves the public
Brendberg-Schadt-Ellsworth parent by $0.0000768618004216131$. The release classifies the
result as a construction-only upper bound and says it used outward-rounded interval
arithmetic, a 300-digit zero-tolerance recomputation, and an independent published
checker. The public release does not include the interval boxes, governed receipt, or
replayable checker needed to inspect the formal claim.
This repository recorded the value as reported.
The formal lane held the exact $9 \times 9$ grid construction until this intake.

## The lower bound

The verified floor is a local deduction from wand125’s retained
[`cert_n69_L841.json`](../resources/web/external-square-certificates-2026-09-22/wand125-points/certificates/cert_n69_L841.json).
The native exact verifier completed all 201 directions and all five certificate
conditions successfully; its exact total mass is $846701027/12500000 < 68$. The count
enters only through the strict mass inequality, so replacing the source file’s target 69
by 68 changes no geometric premise.
The remaining mass margin is $3298973/12500000$. The
[replay log](../resources/web/external-square-certificates-2026-09-22/receipts/wand125-points/sqpack-exact-replay.log)
and
[mathematical review](../../docs/project/reviews/review-2026-09-22-tokoharu-density-mathematics.md#supplemental-review-predecessor-point-adapter)
retain the evidence and derivation.
This is a local consequence of the external certificate, with no claim of priority; the
upstream README announces n69 rather than n68.

The selected literal external report, [Friedman DS7], gives the lower-bound expression
`2*sqrt(2) + 71/13` for $s(68)$ (approximately $8.289965586285$). Friedman’s DS7 survey,
Theorem 9, k=8, reports this bound at n=65; reference [8] is Green’s private
communication (2000). The source proof has not been recovered.
The unavoidable-set argument DS7’s Figure 34 illustrates does not prove it: at $k = 8$
that point pattern leaves a unit square empty
([review](../../docs/project/reviews/review-2026-10-02-green-ds7-theorem9.md)).
Inherited at n=68 by monotonicity.
That value remains in the reported field, separate from the stronger locally derived
verified floor. The [source audit](../devtools/audit_ds7_lower_bounds.py) compares the
exact theorem expressions separately from opaque table decimals.
Nagamochi’s general bound `1 + sqrt(53)` remains valid historical evidence and is
superseded as this case’s strongest verified floor.
**Corrected 2 October 2026:** its published proof rests on Nagamochi’s Lemma 1, which
Karakuş showed false, so it is now a reported bound
([review](../../docs/project/reviews/review-2026-10-02-nagamochi-lemma1-karakus.md)).
This register had recorded that proof as verified, its own error, logged as defect
[D-516](../../defects.md).
